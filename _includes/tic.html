The Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) Initiative aims to improve the Federal Government’s security posture through the consolidation of external telecommunication connections, by establishing a set of baseline security capabilities through enhanced monitoring and situational awareness of all external network connections.<p></p>

The purpose of the TIC Initiative is to reduce, consolidate, and secure connects to the Federal Government, including those to the Internet. The initiative is improving the Federal Government’s security posture and incident response capability through the reduction and consolidation of external connections and providing enhanced monitoring and situational awareness of external network connections.<p></p>

On June 8, 2015, Federal CIO, Tony Scott, signed Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum, M-15-13, detailing a policy to require secure connections across federal websites and web services. The policy requires all agencies to make existing websites and services accessible through a secure connection (HTTPS) by the end of 2016.<p></p>

In 2017, GSA took another significant step forward in making secure communication the default for federal web services by automatically enforcing HTTPS in modern web browsers for newly issued executive branch .gov domains and their subdomains.<p></p>
<A href="https://pulse.cio.gov/https/domains/">Pulse.cio.gov</A> monitors the status of federal (.gov) domains supporting the HTTPS protocol. Data can be downloaded in CSV format and indicates whether each federal domain supports HTTPS protocol and the strength of that support.<p></p>
