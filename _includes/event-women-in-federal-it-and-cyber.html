<strong>OVERVIEW:</strong> In celebration of the Women’s History Month, the Federal Chief Information Officers Council (CIOC) is pleased to host Women in Federal Information Technology and Cybersecurity. The event brings together the nation’s top federal information technology executives to celebrate the success of women thriving in today’s federal IT enterprise and to discuss strategies that engage, inspires, and motivate more women to pursue a career in IT. 
As demonstrated by the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), building and maintaining a workforce with modern technology skills is a key priority, and the CIOC is committed to supporting these efforts.  Through this event, participants will hear stories from some of the Federal IT and Cyber community’s highly successful leaders to share their perspectives about how women can thrive in IT careers and purse IT and cybersecurity career opportunities.  Attendees will also hear from newly appointed Federal CIO Suzette Kent as she shares strategies the administration is implementing from the PMA to build a modern federal IT workforce.
