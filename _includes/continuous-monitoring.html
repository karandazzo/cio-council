Continuous monitoring is a risk management approach to cybersecurity that maintains an accurate picture of an agency’s security risk posture, provides 
visibility into assets, and leverages use of automated data feeds to quantify risk, ensure effectiveness of security controls, and implement prioritized 
remedies. A well-designed and well-managed continuous monitoring program can effectively transform an otherwise static security control assessment and risk 
determination process into a dynamic process that provides essential, near real-time security status.<p></p>

In today’s environment of widespread cyber-intrusions, advanced persistent threats, and insider threats, it is essential for agencies to have real-time 
accurate knowledge of their enterprise IT security posture so that responses to external and internal threats can be made swiftly.<p></p>

<H3>EINSTEIN</H3>
The National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) is an integrated system-of-systems that delivers a range of capabilities, including intrusion 
detection, analytics, intrusion prevention, and information sharing. The NCPS capabilities, operationally known as the <A 
href="https://www.dhs.gov/einstein">EINSTEIN</A> program, are one of a number of 
tools and capabilities that assist in federal network defense. <A href="https://www.dhs.gov/einstein">EINSTEIN</A> 
provides a common baseline of security across the federal civilian executive branch and to help agencies manage their cyber risk. EINSTEIN serves two key 
roles in federal government cybersecurity. First, EINSTEIN detects and blocks cyber attacks from compromising federal agencies. Second, EINSTEIN provides DHS 
with the situational awareness to use threat information detected in one agency to protect the rest of the government and to help the private sector protect 
itself.<p></p>

<H3>CONTINUOUS DIAGNOSTICS AND MITIGATION (CDM)</H3>
The <A href="https://www.dhs.gov/cdm">Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation</A> (CDM) program is a dynamic approach to fortifying the 
cybersecurity of government networks and systems. CDM provides federal departments and agencies with capabilities and tools that identify cybersecurity 
risks on an ongoing basis, prioritize these risks based upon potential impacts, and enable cybersecurity personnel to mitigate the most significant problems 
first. Congress established the CDM program to provide adequate, risk-based, and cost-effective cybersecurity and more efficiently allocate cybersecurity 
resources.<p></p>

 <H3>NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY AND COMMUNICATIONS INTEGRATION CENTER (NCCIC)</H3>
The <A href="https://www.dhs.gov/national-cybersecurity-and-communications-integration-center">National 
Cybersecurity and Communications Integrations Center</A> (NCCIC) housed in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a 24/7 cyber situational awareness, 
incident response, and management center that is a national nexus of cyber and communications integration for the federal government, intelligence community, 
and law enforcement. NCCIC shares information among the public and private sectors to provide greater understanding of cybersecurity and communications 
situation awareness of vulnerabilities, intrusions, incidents, mitigation, and recovery actions.<p></p>
